"""
Text file utility functions for common file operations.

This module provides helper methods for working with text files, including
line counting, file previewing, and file loading capabilities. The TextFileHelper 
class implements static methods for efficient file operations without requiring
class instantiation.

Key features:
- Line counting for text files
- File previewing with configurable line limits
- Complete file loading with header/footer skipping
- Configurable whitespace handling and encoding
